# Cross-Core-Data-Leakage-via-Cache
This involves implementation of Cache based side-channel implementations between different cores of a processor. Different types of data transmission has been implemented like Flush-Reload and Cache Occupancy based attacks. These types of communication allows low moderate data-rates upto 8-10Kbps with accuracy above 90%
